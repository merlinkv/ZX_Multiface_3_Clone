# ZX_Multiface_3_Clone

An enhanced and updated version of the Romantic Robot Multiface 3 for ZX Spectrum +3 computers.

The following project is a modified and improved version of the Multiface 3 interface originally designed by Romantic Robot UK LTD.
The Spanish company Hard Micro made, back in 1988, a clone of the Multiface 3. Since then there have been no more recreations that I know of.

The Multiface 3 is a multipurpose interface designed for ZX Spectrum +3 computers that, among many other functionalities,
allows us to make backup copies of programs or games on tape or disk. If used on the + 2A / + 2B models, such copies can only be made on tape.

The main changes compared to the original model are:

- Dual ROM based on a W27E257
- GAL16V8B
- RAM 6264 or 62256.
- RESET button.
- Decoupling capacitors for all IC's.
- Horizontal EDGE connector.
- PCB designed to put inside a printed 3D case.
- Kempston Joystick interface (can be enabled or disabled)
